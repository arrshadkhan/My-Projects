A mathematical fractal visualization using Python Turtle Graphics.
# 🌿 Barnsley Fern (Python Turtle)

This project generates the **Barnsley Fern fractal** using **Python Turtle Graphics**.  
It demonstrates how complex natural patterns can emerge from simple mathematical rules using randomness and affine transformations.

---

## 🔹 About the Project
The Barnsley Fern is a classic example of a **fractal** created using an **Iterated Function System (IFS)**.  
Starting from a single point, the program repeatedly applies random transformations to produce a fern-like structure.

This project draws **100,000 points** efficiently using Turtle’s optimized rendering.

## 🚀 Features
- Pure **Python** (no external libraries)
- Uses **Turtle Graphics**
- Optimized rendering with `tracer(0)`
- Randomized affine transformations
- High-detail fractal generation
- Clean green-on-black visual output
